The python script for the 1st problem is given here.
I have used 4 types of sample cases: 
1. inp1 = "30, Barpeta, Barpeta, Assam 781301" 
Here, the address is a correct address with the post office name, hence it prints out as correct addres

2. inp2 = "2nd Phase, 374/B, 80 Feet Rd, Bank Colony, Banashankari (3rd Stage/0, Srinivasa Nagar, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560050" 
Here the addrress is with special characters in order to show that its a correct address if it has the correct post office name

3. inp3 = "2nd Phase, 374/B, 80 Feet Rd, Mysore Bank Colony, Banashankari 3rd Stage, Srinivasa Nagar, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560095"
Here, the address is incorrect , since the post office name and the pincode doesn't match

4. inp4 = "Colony, Bengaluru, Karnataka " 
Here, the address is with no pincode, hence the address is incoreect.
